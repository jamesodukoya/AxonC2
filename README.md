> **A next-generation Command and Control platform engineered for real-time UAV telemetry processing, AI-powered perception, and ultra-low-latency mission control.**

## Project Overview

Axon C2 is a sophisticated, full-stack command and control system designed for autonomous vehicle operations. The platform combines cutting-edge C++20 asynchronous programming with modern web technologies to deliver real-time telemetry visualization, AI-powered threat detection, and seamless mission control capabilities.

### Architecture Highlights

- **High-Performance Core**: Built with C++20 coroutines and lock-free data structures
- **Real-Time Processing**: Sub-millisecond telemetry ingestion using custom memory pools
- **AI Perception Engine**: NVIDIA TensorRT-optimized inference with hardware-accelerated video decoding  
- **Modern Frontend**: React + TypeScript with WebRTC live streaming and 3D situational displays
- **Scalable Backend**: Boost.Asio event-driven architecture with Redis caching and SQLite persistence

## Key Features
